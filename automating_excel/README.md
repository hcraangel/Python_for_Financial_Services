automating_excel

this is a mini project for getting datas from one excel worksheet to fill in other financial statements worksheets.

first, type in "fillin_financial_statements.py" to run the project;

then, input three variables by following the command line instructionsï¼Œone at a time, using format(YYYY-MM-DD)

for example,

end_of_last_year = 2016-12-31

end_of_last_month = 2017-3-31

end_of_this_month = 2017-4-30

in standard practice, these variables are adjusted for financial reporting purposes every time the program is run.

in this case, 135 new excel workbooks will be automatically generated into the results directory.
